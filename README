Bunny Picture Viewer
====================

Or bview for short.

Picture viewer that follows those rules:
- Convenient interface:
  _ Most commonly used functinalities must be easy to find
  _ Specific manipulation can be achieved throught keys
- Basic functionalities:
  _ bview does not have to handle every use in existence,
    but only frequent usage.
- Transparent:
  _ bview must be fast enough to seem instant
  _ bview must not be greedy with memory

Its objective is to replace some picture viewer that may be very powerful
and offers a lot of functionalities but fail at being practical for every
day picture watching.

How to start it using command line:
